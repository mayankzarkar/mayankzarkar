I work on backend systems where correctness, clarity, and longevity matter more than speed of delivery. My focus is on designing architectures that can evolve safely over time, even as requirements, teams, and scale change.

Over the last **8+ years**, I’ve built and stabilised production systems using **Symfony and Laravel**, across both greenfield builds and large legacy platforms.

I prefer systems that are easy to reason about, easy to change, and hard to misuse. I value explicit boundaries over clever abstractions, small reversible decisions over large irreversible ones, and observability over assumptions. Architecture should reduce cognitive load for the team, not increase it, and the best solutions are usually the simplest ones that still respect domain complexity and long-term operational reality.

• Clean application of **design patterns** to reduce coupling and improve testability
• **Domain-Driven Design** to align business language with system structure
• **CQRS-style separation** where read and write concerns diverge under scale
• **Event-Driven Architecture** for decoupled workflows and system resilience
• **Asynchronous jobs and background processing** for long-running and failure-prone tasks
• Well-defined service boundaries and contracts, including **REST and SOAP APIs**
• Robust **third-party service integrations** with retries, idempotency, and failure handling

These techniques are applied pragmatically — not every system needs every pattern, but the right ones matter at the right time.

Public repositories here are **representative**, not exhaustive.
They exist to show **engineering approach, structure, and trade-offs**, not polished commercial products.

Most real-world systems I’ve worked on are client-owned and private.

𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘁𝘆𝗹𝗲

• Bias toward boring, predictable systems
• Strong preference for explicit contracts and data flow
• Comfortable owning architectural decisions and their consequences
• Experienced in mentoring senior engineers and reviewing complex changes
• Pragmatic about trade-offs between purity, delivery, and risk

If you’re building a system that needs to **operate reliably for years**, not just launch successfully, feel free to reach out.
